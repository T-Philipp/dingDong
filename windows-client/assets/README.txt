Place application icons here. File names like bell.ico, dingdong.ico, or icon.ico will be embedded automatically at build time.
If no icon is provided, the app will fall back to a system icon.

Note: To have the EXE file itself show this icon in Explorer, ensure bell.ico exists here; the project sets it as ApplicationIcon.Place optional app icon here (bell.ico). The project works without a custom icon.
